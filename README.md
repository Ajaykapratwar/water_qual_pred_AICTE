# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting water quality using chemical parameter data such as ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, and more.

## âœ… Current Progress (Week 1)

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`.csv`) with semicolon (`;`) delimiter.
- Converted date column to proper `datetime` format.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including:
  - Histograms and boxplots to understand distribution and outliers
  - Time-series trends for selected pollutants
  - Correlation heatmap to study relationships between chemical indicators
